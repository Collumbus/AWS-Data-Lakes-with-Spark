# AWS-Data-Lakes-with-Spark
This project builds an **ETL pipeline** for a **data lake**. The data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in the app. We loaded data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using **Spark**, and load them back into S3.
